      <header>Create a Model</header>
      <p>To make a part, you must first develop a 3D model. Computer Aided Design
        (CAD) programs provide the tools to do this. If you have access to
        SolidWorks, that will likely be the best software. Otherwise,
        <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">TinkerCad.com</a> is a great free
        and internet browser-based CAD program.<p>
        <code>NOTE: Instructions on using CAD software to develop the model are
          beyond the scope of these instructions. Please refer to software
          documentation for tutorials and instructions.</code>
      <p>When your model is complete, save it in .STL format. Then you are ready
        to load your file into the slicer software!
    </section>
    <section id="Generate_G-code" class="main-section">
      <header>Generate G-code</header>
      <p>Next you will need to convert your 3D model into a language that the
        printer understands. G-code is a file format understood by 3D printers.
        It is a set of instructions that tell the 3D printer what parameters to
        follow in creating the model. These parameters include nozzle movement,
        nozzle and heatbed temperatures, filament feed speed, fan speed, etc.
        When these instructions are executed in order, you end up with a print.</p>

      <p>You might need to adjust some of the print settings to optimize for
        your material of choice. Recommended print settings can be found in
        <a href="https://help.prusa3d.com/en/category/material-guide_220">
          Prusa's Material Guide</a>. You must save your completed g-code to an
          SD card or USB flash drive. Once this is complete, you are ready to
          move to the printer.</p>

    <section id="Prepare_Printer" class="main-section">
      <header>Prepare Printer</header>
      <p>Insert your SD card to the printer. Select <code>Print from SD card
        </code>, then load your choice of filament
        spool onto the spool holder. Make sure the material
        you load is the same as the material you specified in your g-code. Allow
        the printer nozzle to pre-heat.</p>
      <code><strong>WARNING!</strong>: From this point on <strong>DO NOT TOUCH
        THE NOZZLE</strong>. It is hot up to 200 &#176;C.</code>
      <p>Make sure you cut the filament tip to a
        point with a pair of wire cutters. When directed by the LCD display,
        insert the filament into the extruder. Filament will begin coming out
        of the nozzle. When the filament loading is complete, remove waste
        material from the nozzle and print area.</p>
      <img src="LoadingFilament.png" alt="Loading filament intot the extruder">
      <p>Before pre-heating of the heatbed, you will need to prepare the
        print surface. Some materials like PLA will only require a clean surface
        on the Smooth PEI sheet. You should clean the print surface with 90+%
        isopropyl alcohol and a wipe. Other materials may require a film of
        Windex or glue stick to be applied. More detailed information of print
        surface prep can be found in
        <a href="https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/first-layer-issues_1804">
          Prusa's First Layer Issues guide</a>.</p>

    <section id="Print_Your_Part" class="main-section">
      <header>Print Your Part</header>
      <p>Select pre-heat from the menu and start the print. The LCD display will
        show the pre-heat data and the printer will begin the mesh bed leveling.
        After leveling is complete, the nozzle purge will lay a strip of
        filament in the front left corner of the print table. Afterwards you
        should select "Live adjust Z" and see
        <code>Adjusting Z:
              X.XXX mm</code>
        on the display as the first layer starts. You should adjust the z-height
        of the nozzle with the selector wheel until the filament bead forms a
        flattened oval cross-section shape. This should be close to -1 mm.</p>
      <img src="zHeightGuide.png" alt="Adjust z-height until filament bead is slightly squished">
      <p>Now your print is commencing and you just have to wait. Come back in
        a few hours to a day for average prints to collect your part.</p>
        <code><strong>WARNING!</strong>: Watch the first few printed layers to
          be sure the filament has attached to the bed properly (5 to 10
          minutes).</code>

    <section id="Removing_Your_Print" class="main-section">
      <header>Removing Your Print</header>
      <p>First let the nozzle, heatbed, and part cool. To remove your print,
        remove the entire build plate from the heatbed. A gentle bend of the
        build plate in both directions should free the part. If the part is not
        easily releasing, you may push a plastic spatula under the corner of
        your part to help gently pry it free. Remove the part and clean the bed
        again with isopropyl alcohol.</p>

      <p>Congratulations! You printed a part! Happy printing!</p>
